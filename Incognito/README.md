> Work in progress

This plugin blocks Discord's telemetry, analytics, experiment tracking, Sentry error reporting, crash reports, process monitoring, usage metrics, and read receipts while also providing privacy features like disabling idle detection, hiding typing indicators, stripping tracking parameters from URLs, spoofing fingerprints, hiding client mods, and anonymising uploaded files with random names and stripping image metadata.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This plugin reduces ongoing tracking but can't stop data from the initial handshake, like what's saved and sent when Discord boots up. Full coverage would be at the Electron level.
