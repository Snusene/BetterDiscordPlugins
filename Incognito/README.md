This plugin blocks Discord's telemetry, analytics, error reporting, Sentry crash reporting, process monitoring, and user affinity tracking while also providing privacy features like disabling idle detection, stripping tracking parameters from URLs, spoofing fingerprint data (system locale and app focus state), hiding your typing indicator, Spotify activity, game activity, anonymising uploaded file names, and defeating message loggers.
