Discord fires analytics on virtually every interaction. Incognito blocks all of it: tracking, telemetry, usage profiling, error reporting, and process scanning. Also hides what you've read and when you're typing, disables idle detection, spoofs fingerprints, strips URL tracking parameters, anonymises uploads, hides client mods, and more. All features can be toggled from the settings panel.

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin reduces ongoing surveillance but can't block what Discord sends on startup. Full coverage would be at the Electron level.
