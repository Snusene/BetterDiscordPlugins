A privacy plugin for BetterDiscord. It blocks telemetry, analytics, debug logs, activity reporting, usage metrics, Sentry error reporting, crash reports, process scanning, RPC, Nitro promotion tracking, and read receipts. It also disables idle detection, hides your typing indicator, spoofs your fingerprints, hides client mods from Discord, strips tracking parameters from URLs, and anonymises uploaded files by randomising names and stripping image metadata. Everything is toggleable from the settings panel.

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin reduces ongoing surveillance but can't block the initial handshake, what Discord saves and sends on startup. Full coverage would be at the Electron level.
